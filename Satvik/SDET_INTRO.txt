I am a Tenacious and detail-driven SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) with hands-on experience building scalable, maintainable automation frameworks for both UI and API testing. I specialize in delivering high-quality software through test automation, continuous integration, and strong engineering principles. My work reflects a deep commitment to clean code, structured testing, and real-world reliability.

Technical Skill Set:

* Automation Tools & Languages:
  Python, Selenium WebDriver, PyTest, Behave (BDD), XPath Locators, CSS Selectors

* Framework Design:
  Modular POM structure, reusable utility functions, fixtures, hooks, Excel-driven test suites, dynamic waits, assertions

* API Testing:
  Postman, Python requests, REST API validation, JSON schema verification, status code checks

* CI/CD & DevOps:
  Jenkins, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions — building and managing automation pipelines with source control

* Testing Lifecycle & Agile:
  Jira for bug tracking and sprint tasks, Agile/Scrum methodology, test planning and execution within sprint cycles

* Other Areas:
  Linux-based automation, MySQL database testing, command-line scripting, backend validation, web scraping

Why I Stand Out as an SDET:
* I don’t just automate — I design test solutions that are scalable, reusable, and built for long-term reliability
* I focus on clean, modular code to ensure smooth collaboration and maintainability across teams
* I proactively log, debug, and report bugs to accelerate development feedback cycles
* I bring strong ownership, a collaborative mindset, and consistent delivery in Agile teams

Mindset

I believe the best SDETs combine developer-level thinking with user-centric testing and engineering-grade automation. I stay continuously updated with the latest tools, patterns, and practices to improve quality and shorten feedback loops. Whether working on a framework or testing critical business logic, I strive for precision, clarity, and impact. Looking forward to contributing to a team where software quality is a priority, automation is embraced, and continuous learning is encouraged.
